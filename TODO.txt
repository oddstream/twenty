[ ] two-way map to link *Cell and *Tile




run gravity in update()
look for one tile to move (starting at bottom), then quit
don't move a tile if it is lerping or dragging



[ ] as soon as a tile is moved, out from original cell,
	it should be homeless
	so tiles stacked above can be gravity
	moving tile should track owning cell as it's moved
	so strokeStop should do less work
	(you can't cancel a stroke and send tile back)
[ ] use different easing function instead of smoother step - accel under gravity and bounce

	http://twenty.frenchguys.net/twenty-game.js uses easeInOut

function easeInOut(t) {
	if (t<0.5) {
		return t*t*2;
	} else {
		return 1-(1-t)*(1-t)*2;
	}
}

function interpolate(from,to,t) {
	return from+(to-from)*t;
}

function drawParticles(frame, pos) {
		var x=150*(frame%6);
		var y=150*((frame/6)|0);
		canvas.drawImage(gfx.particles,x,y,150,150,
			pos.x-75, pos.y-37, 150, 150);
	}

[X] insert new row at bottom
[X] list of merged tile values
[X] start with 2 rows of random 1 .. 3
[X] repeat Tile.lerpTo not working
[X] func check integrity
[X] Tile
[X] Draw some tiles
[X] Drag and drop tiles
