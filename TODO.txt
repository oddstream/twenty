are cells even required?
why not piles?
tile wants to be at x = margin + pile pos
with margin=10 and pileWidth=100
pos 255 is pile 255-10=245, 245/100=2
pos 45 is pile 45-10/100=0
then pile is just a number, not a struct
gravity just drops each tile while the bottom of it's outerbox is > top of box below on same pile
can then use easeInout for vertical, smoothstep for horz

new row of tiles starts off grid at the bottom
gravity is suspended while they float up (lerp) one tile height
meanwhile all the other tiles float (lerp) up one tile height
when floating is finished, gravity is turned back on
i.e. in float mode, all tiles lerp up one tile height

under gravity, each tile moves down
unless tile is at bottom of grid
or if there is no tile below
so gravity needs to work from bottom up
so tiles need to be sorted into descending pos.Y order first

tiles can fall under gravity with acceleration, not just one pixel per tick
const gravity = 9.8
object.velocity += gravity * float64(step)
object.position += object.velocity * float64(step)

moves
	onto empty cell
	onto tile with same value
happens in strokeStop
strokeMOve should just do bounds checking
