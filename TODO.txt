[ ] finish when there are static tiles outside of the grid rectangle?
	maybe no need for header and footer

[X] "you get a new row when you run out of moves"
	"or when the timer runs out"
	(or every 6 (columns-1) moves in Zen mode)

[ ] dragging a tile into header
	just before lerping all the tiles up

[ ] how many merges happen because of this one mouse down-drag-release?

[ ] twenty: just moving a tile doesn't count as a row-creating move
	seems to be 6, 7 or 8 merges
[X] 12 second timer
	rounded rect grey bar in header area
	light grey background, same as grid
	darker grey shrinks from right to left
[ ] new footer row does not contain any merges with tiles above
[X] don't drag a lerping tile
[ ] don't add footer row if there is any stroke, dragging, lerping
[X] game over when tiles in header

tiles with the same value are transparent to each other -
they can drag or lerp over each other
a separate deamon merges stacked tiles with the same row, column

[X] stop dragging outside grid
[ ] stop dragging through other tiles
[X] sounds (detect combos)
[ ] undo stack
[ ] timer-bar
[ ] link_lr and link_ud (rounded rects) starting at level 10

[ ] easing
	http://twenty.frenchguys.net/twenty-game.js uses easeInOut

function easeInOut(t) {
	if (t<0.5) {
		return t*t*2;
	} else {
		return 1-(1-t)*(1-t)*2;
	}
}

function interpolate(from,to,t) {
	return from+(to-from)*t;
}

function drawParticles(frame, pos) {
		var x=150*(frame%6);
		var y=150*((frame/6)|0);
		canvas.drawImage(gfx.particles,x,y,150,150,
			pos.x-75, pos.y-37, 150, 150);
	}
