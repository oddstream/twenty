[ ] func check integrity
[ ] as soon as a tile is moved, out from original cell,
	it should be homeless
	so tiles stacked above can be gravity
	moving tile should track owning cell as it's moved
	so strokeStop should do less work
	(you can't cancel a stroke and send tile back)
[ ] Tile.lerpTo not working
[ ] use different easing function instead of smoother step - accel under gravity and bounce
